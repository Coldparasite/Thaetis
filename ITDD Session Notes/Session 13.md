## Recap

The party started out the last session in quite a predicment seeing a rather large pack of wolves standing atop the exit of the tomb they were just in. Grips casting speak with animals was able to communicate with the wolves to find out that they didn't appreciate the looting of the tomb and demanded the magic items stolen from the sarcophagus be returned. The party did so and left swiftly after setting up camp in the middle of the plans. 

In the night Kaarth fufilled his deal with Savant and placed the coin on the Voroldon's spellbook causing it to go up in flames. This led to some minor confusion in the gang as no one fessed up to the stealing. Kaarth revealed his ties to the gambler and explained things to taalo but nothing really came of this.

Attempting to enter the town they were met with the gate guard recognize them and then taking them to meet the guard captain Something Kerrigan the brother of Alexander. In that meeting Grips snuck off to go do Grips things and the gang tried to make a deal with Kerrigan. This deal ended quite well for the group on the promise that they would go meet Kerrigans associate at Grimsby's inn though they have no idea who they are really meeting.

The party ended the session giving Blunderbuss all of Voroldon's books to go to Skeksi's store alone.
