Previous session: [[Session 19]]

# Session Prep
 Recap: The party continued their adventure heading north of Southbury and eventually came to some boats where they ran into old friends cliffton and Jerome and had a big ol combat encounter with some wolves which grips took great care of and then the wyvern dove in and nearly fucked shit up. The session ended with some conflict as Johan is a bit worried about the Watcher being pissed and the session ended with the party entering Viskar.
