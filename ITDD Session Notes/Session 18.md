### Dinner with the Viskars
The party will start out the session having dinner at White Water Keep after having been invited by Duke Caladan. People who will be attending are Cassion GoldenFlask, Fereldon Viskari, Solstano, Duke Caladan, and the star of the show Kipp Scotch. 

The scene will open with dinner being served and everyone being sat down and then the questions will start to come in around the dinner table. The party may ask about Strix and will be shrugged off as though he is unknown but may be told about him. Kipp is going to ask a bunch of questions. At some point whenever the question what will they do next Solstano will mention Strellyn but be shut down.

Strix - A Dabberathian spy who was captured about 3 weeks ago after he tried to kill duke Caladan along with some other agents. This event has led to the Viskari's mistrust of all Dabberathians at the current time and is why they chose to burn down white water village as they are looking for Vinncent WhiteStar a man who was named by Strix as orchestrating the attempted assissination.
