## Recap

## Prep

### Grimsby's Brawl
It is now nearing midnight if the party looks outside they'll notice its probably about 11:00pm, and Baxter will show up a bit after midnight.

### Skeksi's Shop
The shop is closed but if they knock on the door Skeksi will come down and invite them in. Depending what they say Skeksi will mention that he cannot read the books but Celine Tokek can and that she is a ward of the Viskari's. He'll say he can take the books to her just not at the moment and that it'll probably be a day or two before he can give them to her and he has no idea when she'll translate them.

If they mention that wolves took the spellbook Skeksi gets an insight roll. But anyh mention that they ran into wolves will make Skeksi very worried but he'll give them the book History of the Duchy of Viskar and will try to push them out of the store. 

### Dukes Invitational 
Tonight is the night of the full moon and the Duke will take action against the rising threat of the WhiteStars. Many riders will be seen throughout the night as a spy has been captured and informed Caladan that the DEA has contracted the WhiteStars to kill him.

White Water Inn Burns the night of the full moon

If the party teleports back to white water after midnight they will be in a burning building and we'll go from there.
### Riddentrout reward
If the party kills Baxter then Kerrigan will tell them they will recieve the reward just the Duke will personally give it to them tomorrow evening.
