	This session is planned to be in person.
	
	The party will resume in the parlar area where Grips took the Phantasmal Candle. They have explored much of the open area of the tomb though they have no investigated the hidden door. They have seen the ooze and gone in the room with the ooze though they haven't tried to fight it yet.
	
	Grips looted a chest and searched a book case though no one has attempted to open the tomb.
