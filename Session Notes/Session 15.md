# Session Prep

## Recap

The party hung around the bar until a bit before midnight before hastely leaving in an attempt to avoid Baxter RiddenTrout. During this time they went out chased down Jerrod Carsgrove and brought him back to the bar. There was also some chatter between the players and the barkeep when he started to call them murderers. Eventually the party was able to intimidate him to the point where he agreed to leave and not report what they had done. After collecting some of the loot Grips found and decoded letter that Valandry had though it didn't make much sense.

The party left the party know the east gate was probably guarded and decided to split the party into two groups BlunderBuss, Grips and Taalo in the first group would use the teleport candle to by pass the gate and go to the White Water Inn. While the other group of Johan and Kaarth would take the prisoner Jerrod and attempt to make it through the gate.

BlunderBuss, Grips, and Taalo using the teleport candle found themselves in a burning building and through the chaos tried to save the barkeep known as Checker. As flames engulfed all around them they were able to rush out the front door and found them amongst the attack party.

## Prep

### Grimsby's Brawl
It is now nearing midnight if the party looks outside they'll notice its probably about 11:00pm, and Baxter will show up a bit after midnight.

### Skeksi's Shop
The shop is closed but if they knock on the door Skeksi will come down and invite them in. Depending what they say Skeksi will mention that he cannot read the books but Celine Tokek can and that she is a ward of the Viskari's. He'll say he can take the books to her just not at the moment and that it'll probably be a day or two before he can give them to her and he has no idea when she'll translate them.

If they mention that wolves took the spellbook Skeksi gets an insight roll. But anyh mention that they ran into wolves will make Skeksi very worried but he'll give them the book History of the Duchy of Viskar and will try to push them out of the store. 

### Dukes Invitational 
Tonight is the night of the full moon and the Duke will take action against the rising threat of the WhiteStars. Many riders will be seen throughout the night as a spy has been captured and informed Caladan that the DEA has contracted the WhiteStars to kill him.

White Water Inn Burns the night of the full moon

If the party teleports back to white water after midnight they will be in a burning building and we'll go from there.
