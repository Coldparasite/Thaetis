## Background
Hailing from a small logging village in Dabberath, I lived a humble life for many years. For many years I lived peacefully with my family, spending my days in the forests and the nights at home. Until one terrible evening I arrived to find my family laid out before me, lifeless and cold. I knew what had happened, the looks from the men in the market, the stares and the laughs. They killed them both and thought nothing of it, then pinned it on me like I’m some kind of sociopath. Nothing worth staying for anyway, not anymore at least. I find myself venturing further and further as the years drag on. I’m not too sure what I’m looking for at this point, it started out as a way to find another place to settle into, find someone new, but as each day passes I grow more and more sure I’ll never move on. Not after that. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t hate every man I saw for what they did, but the further I get the less and less likely it is I ever find the bastard that did it in the first place.
like a sentence or two of how you got to where you're going and why: After the death of my family, I left my old home behind. Fearing not to return to that horrible place, I venture on in search of new meaning, now finding myself preparing to cross the Dabberatian Mountains.

Kaarth was married and had a kid in his early 20's, and that family lasted about 10 years until the events that led him to leave home.

Bounty Hunting days probably started with his father when he was a young adult like 16 and continued until he was 22ish at which point he met his wife. After the death of his family he picked up the trade slowly making his way through Dabberath until the start of the campaign.
